      "What is the problem? The problem we are focusing is that school education is very crucial and important part of education. Practical knowledge can make the learning better. Most of Indian schools lack fundamental infrastructure. Many of them don't have labs. The best way to learn is observation or practical works as one philosopher said child learn through experience. But Most of the students Don't get chance to experiment as most of the schools don't have labs. HE BHAGWAN KYA ZULM HAI \n",

      "Slide 5 Text:\n",
      "Problem Statement From the market, only a few expensive apps exist for students, with limited experimentation capabilities. To enable school-level experiments with accurate measurements, while being affordable and user-friendly. So as the student will get the platform they were looking for at reasonable price and student. Despite some student donâ€™t have mobile phone or laptop. \n",

      "When and Where Does the Problem Occur? 12th class We found the problem due to COVID 19 pandemic where the practical was conducted within one-two week. Colleges where there is large number of student. when we learn to conduct practical in large gathering and in safe environment. In field such as alchemy, where various attempts are made to convert base metal into gold. \n",
      "\n",
      "Slide 7 Text:\n",
      "Why is it a Problem? Chemical are expensive, and most of the school are unable to order it. There can be lack of practical equipment in the institution where every student has different level of understanding. So someone who require more chance to do practical is unable to understand the concept. Last movement the vision where it gives chance to do the practical just before the exam. \n",

      "Who is Facing the Problem? Labster is a valuable tool for students, teachers, and researchers. Students: As a student it is important to learn practical implementation without the fear of breaking instruments or dealing with limited resources. Teachers: As a teacher they have a lot of students to teach at a same time. They can use Labster to ensure their safety when working with chemicals. Researchers: They can revisit and apply their previous knowledge through Labster, making it convenient for basic implementations and workshops.

      "Our Ideas Creating Physical Labs: Establishing safe and well-equipped environments for hands-on experiments. Providing qualified and knowledgeable teachers. Designing experiments aligned with the curriculum and learning goals. Creating Digital Labs: Developing interactive virtual simulations of real labs. Incorporating tools for data analysis and interpretation. Enabling remote access to labs for convenience. Hybrid Labs: Balancing learning approaches by combining physical and digital labs. Utilizing virtual labs for preparation and practice. Providing flexibility through remote access to labs. \n",

Incorporating tools for data analysis and interpretation. Providing software or interfaces for data analysis. Enhancing data visualization and understanding. Enabling remote access for convenience. Allowing students to access labs from anywhere. Providing flexibility and convenience for remote learning. Fostering collaboration through online platforms. Facilitating communication and collaboration among students and teachers. Encouraging sharing of insights and resources for enhanced learning. \n",
